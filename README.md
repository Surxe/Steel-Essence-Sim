# Steel-Essence-Sim
Simulates Steel Essence resource averages gathered from Warframe (game) in Steel Path mode

Acolyte spawns every 3-7 minutes, dropping 2 Steel Essence.

With the [[Charm|https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Charm]] mod, every 27s buff is rolled, with a 28% chance to get any buff, and a 20% chance for the buff to be the resource buff. 

The resource buff doubles all loot gained from Acolytes for 156 seconds, stacking multiplicatively. 

Since it can stack, this makes it possible to get a 4x multiplier, or ideally an 8x multiplier.

Steel Essence dropped from Acolytes can be left on the ground and never be despawned so long as all other nearby drops are actively picked up.

The user can decide to pick up the Steel Essence instantly with no multiplier, without needing to stress about watching the buff timer.

Alternatively, they can wait for a 2x buff, or a 4x buff, or even an 8x buff before claiming the resources. 

Usually, a mission will have a feasible length of 1 hour, meaning there can be 1 hours worth of Acolyte's Steel Essence laying on the ground. 

A 4x buff will occur on average twice in that 1 hour span, allowing the entirety of the resources gained so far to be quadrupled.
